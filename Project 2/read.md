PROBLEM 1

In this code, the path of the video should be changed according to the path in your system.
Total 146 frames are shown, so it takes time to run the entire video.
After video is shown, 4 plots are shown.
First plot is of translation, 2nd is of roll, 3rd is of pitch, 4th is of yaw wrt the frames.

No non standard libraries need to be installed.


PROBLEM 2

Problem 2 will also take some time to show the output.
First output will be of stitched panoroma image when stitched from image 1 to image 2.
Second output will be of stitched panoroma image when stitched from image 4 to image 1.

wait for some time after output 1 to get the output 2.

No non standard libraries need to be installed.
